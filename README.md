# Identify any code style guide or styling conventions that the application will adhere to.

This code used PEP 8 [1] as code style guide.

[1] Guido van Rossum, Barry Warsaw, Nick Coghlan. (2013, Aug 1). PEP 8 â€“ Style Guide for Python Code. Retrieved from https://peps.python.org/pep-0008/

# Develop a list of features that will be included in the application. It must include: at least THREE features & describe each feature

- Create a new to-do list: Allow users to create a new list with a case-insensitive list name and list items. Each item consists of case-insensitive item name, priority level and due date. During the create process, the users can exit the app or go back to the main menu at any time. However, the app doesn't allow the user to create a list with a name which is in the list collection already.

- Edit an existing list: Allow users to edit the existing list in the list collection. The users can add additional items to the list, modify the existing items in the list and remove the existing items from the list. Regards to item modification, the users can update the item's name, priority level and due date. During the edit, the users can exit the app, or go back to the main menu or to the upper level menu at any time.
  
- Delete an existing list. Allow users to delete the existing lists.
  
- View an existing list. Allow users to view the content of the list.

- Export the non-empty lists in the list collection. Allow users to export the non-empty lists created using the app.

# Develop an implementation plan which: (1) outlines how each feature will be implemented and a checklist of tasks for each feature; (2) prioritise the implementation of different features, or checklist items within a feature; (3) provide a deadline, duration or other time indicator for each feature or checklist/checklist-item
